## Features

---
Right now im trying to fit everything into my schedule but in a near future this will be a fully functional 
program with GUI interface for ease of usage:

- [ ] GUI interface
- [ ] Ability to change animation values
- [x] Rainbowed animation
- [x] Ability to include your own images indicating the folder at exec

## Usage

---

If python is installed / using linux:

```
# * indicates what values need introduced
python main.py -*option *folder 
```

Or if executed from Windows, compiled .exe is bundled inside the downloads page:

```
# * indicates what values need introduced
main.exe -*option *folder
```

The only option available is ``-color`` for the rainbowed parrot.

If no folder is introduced, a parrot will be displayed inside de terminal.
